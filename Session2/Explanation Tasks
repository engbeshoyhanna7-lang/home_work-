1. main function:
   - This is the first function where the program starts.
   - Any code you write will run starting from here.

2. Difference between var, dynamic, and explicit types (like int, String):
   - var:
     * Type is decided from the first value you assign.
     * You cannot change the type later.
     Example: var x = 10;  // now it's int
              x = "Hi";    // ❌ not allowed

   - dynamic:
     * Can hold any type of value.
     * The type can change at runtime.
     Example: dynamic y = 10;
              y = "Hi";    // ✅ allowed

   - Explicit type:
     * You write the type yourself (like int or String).
     * Makes the code clearer and safer.
     Example: int age = 21;
              String name = "Bishoy";
